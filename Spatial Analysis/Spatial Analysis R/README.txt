Plotting using R functions that are in spatial-data-oriented packages (libraries), the (lat,long) location data I collected.
Exploring geospatial data handling in R. 
R's powerful, extensive capabilities (via add-on packages) and simple syntax make it possible to query, analyze and display a variety of spatial data.
I will plot the points collected in two different ways, over a raster map.

The first way I used the 'tmap, tmaptools, rgdal, sp, OpenStreetMap, osmdata' packages.
The second technique uses the 'PBSmapping, ggmap' packages.
